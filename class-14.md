## Local Storage
the Local Storage is an internal database created into the browser, which you can use to save data in a key-value format. Most popular and commonly used browser like Chrome, Firefox and Safari all support Local Storage. The data stored in local storage has no expiration data, so it will persist over closed browser window and session.

Local storage has a very simple set, retrieve and remove API, and the key-value pair is always of string type.
