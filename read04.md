## Things I want to know more about
## React Docs - Forms

### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

-  is one that takes its current value through props and notifies changes 
     through callbacks like onChange.

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses  as soon as they enter them? 

- we should update  the state with their react as fast as they import them.

### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- throw (event.target.value).

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained
### Why would we use a ternary operator?
-  To simplify our if-else statements that are used to assign values to variables.

### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

-  x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false).
