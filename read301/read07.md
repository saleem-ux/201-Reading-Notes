**How I explained REST to my brother**

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

     HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer
     (REST) architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture 
    and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.


2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able 
   to talk to all of the machines in the world?

     - Because of our need to provide determinants, information, and possibilities 
       for accepting transit.


3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    - Fielding belonged to a small Web community that revised the standard into
     an email-like format, allowing users to send and receive hypertext documents.
