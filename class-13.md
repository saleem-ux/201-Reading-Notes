## Chart.js
Chart.js is a community maintained open-source library that helps you easily visualize data using JavaScript.
It supports 8 different chart types (including bars, lines, & pies), and they’re all responsive. In other words, you set up your chart once, and Chart.js will do the heavy-lifting for you and make sure that it’s always legible (for example by removing some uncritical details if the chart gets smaller).
##### to do to draw a chart with Chart.js:
1. Define where on your page to draw the graph.
2. Define what type of graph you want to draw.
3. Supply Chart.js with data, labels, and other options.
## Step 1: Add Chart.js
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.5.0/Chart.min.js"></script>
Copy and paste this row in the html file

## Step 2: Prepare a place in your HTML to render the chart
 adding a canvas element, and setting width and height to define the proportions of your graph.
 <canvas id="myChart" width="1600" height="900"></canvas>

 ## Step 3: Prepare the data
