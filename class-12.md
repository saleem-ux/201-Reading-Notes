## Images
Images can add a lot to your page. They can make it look more appealing but they can also convey information much better than words in many circumstances. Including images is not too difficult but there are a few little tricks to doing it well. In this section we'll look at both.

If you just want to learn about the img tag feel free to read just the first bit but if you want to discover more then I encourage you to keep on reading.

#### Display an image
An image is displayed using an img tag. It stands for image. Within the tag there are several attributes we may include but there are two which are fairly important.

The src attribute stands for source. It is the location of the image which is to be included. It is a standard URL and similar to links may be absolute or relative. See the bit on Location Types in the previous section to find out more.

The alt attribute stands for Alternate Text and is a simple description of what the image is. Normally you won't see the description but it has it's uses.
<img src="URL" alt="image description" >
simple_image.html :
* <body>
* p>Below is an image of a skateboard</p>
* <img src="./img/skateboard.png" alt="A green skateboard" >
* </body>
