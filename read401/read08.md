# Access Control (ACL)

### 1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

#### The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret (see RFC7616 and RFC7617). The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token and is described by the RFC6750

### 2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?

#### A JSON Web Token is used to send information that can be verified and trusted by means of a digital signature. It comprises a compact and URL-safe JSON object, which is cryptographically signed to verify its authenticity, and which can also be encrypted if the payload contains sensitive information

### 3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

* Use encryption to store secrets within .git repositorie(keep it protected by saving it in .env file)
* Use environment variables
* Use “Secrets as a service” solutions
* Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories
* Avoid git add * commands on git
* Add sensitive files in .gitignore
* Don’t rely on code reviews to discover secrets
* Use automated secrets scanning on repositories

|   Encryption   |                                                 it is a process that convert our passwords to hashed ones, with characters representation. to make our passwords secured. we use the bcrypt library to do this.        |
|     Token      |                                          used in bearer authentication, a token is a cryptic string that is generated by the server in response to a login request                                          |
|     bearer     | it is an authorization process, that use the header, and create and compare the token for the users, to allow them to reach a certain endpoints or not. |
|     Secret     |                                                   it is a signature for the developer that make his token secure and no one can access his data when his secret is exists.                                                   |
| JSON Web Token |                     it is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.                  |

### 5 steps to RBAC

* **What is RBAC?**

  **RBAC** is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees,

* **Benefits of RBAC?**

   1. Access control lists (ACL)
   1. Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

## RBAC implementation

1. Inventory your systems
2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
3. Assign people to roles
4. Never make one-off changes
5. Audit

## Three primary rules are defined for RBAC

1. Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
1. Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
1. Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.
