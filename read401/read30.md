# Hash Tables


# Terminology

## Hash

* #### an algorithm takes a string and converts it into a value that could be used for security or some other purpose

* #### in a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array

## Buckets

* #### contained in each index of the array of the hashtable

* #### Each index is a bucket

* #### index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs

## Collisions

* #### what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable


## Hashing is implemented in two steps:

* #### An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table.

* #### The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

```
hash = hashfunc(key)
index = hash % array_size
```

## What are Hash Tables 

* #### a data structure that utilizes key value pairs

* #### every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value

* #### basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key and quickly retrieve the value through a hash

* #### hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location

* #### in the data structure, we can directly retrieve the value

* #### O(1) time complexity for lookups


## Internal Methods

### Add()

* #### send the key to the GetHash method

* #### determine the index of where it should be placed

* #### go to that index

* #### Check if something exists at that index already

* #### if it doesnâ€™t, add it with the key/value pair.

* #### else add the new key/value pair to the data structure within that bucket

### Find()

* #### takes in a key

* #### gets the Hash

* #### goes to the index location specified

### Contains()

* #### accept a key

* #### return a boolean if that key exists inside the hashtable

### GetHash()

* #### GetHash will accept a key as a string

* #### conduct the hash

* #### return the index of the array where the key/value should be placed
