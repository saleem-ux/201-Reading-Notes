## TEXT
When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.
- Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs.
- Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on.
## CSS
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
- To link CCS with HTML types:
1- Using External CSS
//<link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css"
rel="stylesheet" />
2- Usi ng Internal CSS
//<style type="text/css">
