## Boxes
The CSS Box Model is the primary means of layout for everything on the web. It is a standard created by the World Wide Web Consortium which describes layout as rectangular boxes in html which surround every single element on a web page or in the document tree. Using the box model, web designers and developers can make use of various properties such as padding, borders, margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, and many others to create page layouts. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll take a closer look at the CSS Box Model and why it is so important.

## Arrays
In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable. Unlike most languages where array is a reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.
## Switch
Its safe time and effort; instood of writing a number of codes we can use switch statement 
- switch (expression) {
 -  case value1:
    - //Statements executed when the
    - //result of expression matches value1
    - [break;]
 - case value2:
    - //Statements executed when the
    - //result of expression matches value2
    - [break;]
  - ...
  - case valueN:
    - //Statements executed when the
    - //result of expression matches valueN
    - [break;]
  - [default:
    - //Statements executed when none of
    - //the values match the value of the expression
    - [break;]]
- }
